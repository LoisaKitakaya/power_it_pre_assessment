# Recipe and Meal Planning App

## Overview

This project is a full-stack Recipe and Meal Planning Application developed as part of a technical assessment. It consists of a **FastAPI backend** integrated with Googleâ€™s Gemini AI (free tier) to generate structured recipe responses and a **Next.js frontend** with , DaisyUI, and `react-hot-toast` for a responsive, user-friendly interface. The application allows users to submit queries (e.g., "What can I cook with chicken, rice, and broccoli?") and receive detailed recipes with ingredients, instructions, tips, and preparation time.

The project is split into two repositories:
- **Backend**: FastAPI-based API for processing queries and generating recipes.
- **Frontend**: Next.js-based interface for submitting queries and displaying responses.

This repository serves as the entry point for the instructor, providing an overview and links to the backend and frontend repositories, which contain detailed `README.md` files and source code.

## Repositories

- **Backend Repository**: [fastapi_backend](https://github.com/LoisaKitakaya/fastapi_backend)
  - **README**: [README.md](https://github.com/LoisaKitakaya/fastapi_backend/blob/main/README.md)
  - Contains the FastAPI application with, Pydantic models, and Gemini AI integration.
- **Frontend Repository**: [nextjs_frontend](https://github.com/LoisaKitakaya/nextjs_frontend)
  - **README**: [README.md](https://github.com/LoisaKitakaya/nextjs_frontend/blob/main/README.md)
  - Contains the Next.js application with , DaisyUI styling, and `react-hot-toast` for notifications.

**Instructor Note**: Please review the `README.md` files in the backend and frontend repositories for detailed setup instructions, project structure, and usage examples specific to each component.

## Features

- **Backend**:
  - Health check endpoint (`GET /`) to verify API status.
  - Query endpoint (`POST /api/query`) to generate recipes using Gemini AI.
  - Pydantic validation for queries (non-empty).
  - Structured responses with `RecipeResponse` (recipe details) or `ErrorResponse` (errors).
  - CORS support for frontend integration.
  - Dockerized for consistent deployment.

- **Frontend**:
  - Responsive UI with Next.js App Router, and DaisyUI (Tailwind CSS).
  - Query submission form with loading states and error handling via `react-hot-toast`.
  - Displays recipes in a card with ordered lists for ingredients, instructions, and tips.
  - Dockerized for consistent deployment.
